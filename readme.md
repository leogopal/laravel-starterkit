## Laravel 5.8 Starterkit

Laravel Starterkit provides you with a massive head start on any size web application. It comes with a full featured access control system out of the box with an easy to learn API and is built on a Bootstrap foundation with a front and backend architecture.

### Official Documentation

Will be written with LaRecipe in the docs folder in resources in this application.

# Artisan CRUD

Creates a Model, Controller (with Repository, validation Requests, Events and Listeners), Migration, Routes, Breadcrumbs and CRUD Views for the given name ready to work.

It does not overwrite any files that may exist with the pre-stablished names. So, if you delete one of the files and run the command again, the deleted file will be created again and the rest will be ignored and will keep the changes you could have made.

## Run

In your Laravel project root folder:

```
php artisan l5b:crud example
```

Where _example_ is the name you want for your model (routes, views, controllers,...). I've tried to follow best naming practices and it uses plural or singular names and lower or uppercase where needed. You can also use camelCase or snake_case.

Parameters _example_, _Example_, _examples_ or _EXAMPLES_ all give the same results.

Then run the created migration:

```
php artisan migrate
```

In your browser open:

```
https://YOUR_SITE/admin/examples
```

**...et voilÃ ! :)**

Note: out of the box, the table comes only with a _title_ text field, besides the _id_, _deleted_at_, _created_at_ and _updated_at_. Edit your newly created migration file to add any other you may need before runnning the migrate command.

## Options

You can create all the files and run the migration by running the command with the --migrate option:

```
php artisan lg:crud example --migrate

or

php artisan lg:crud example -m
```

You may also specify the name of the default text field 'title' to whatever other you prefer with the --field option:

```
php artisan lg:crud example --field=name

or

php artisan lg:crud example -f name
```

## Include a menu item

A file named _sidebar-examples.blade.php_ is created in the folder _/resources/views/backend/example/includes_. It contains the html code for a menu item to access your recently created views. You can show it in your sidebar by including the following line in _/resources/views/backend/includes/sidebar.blade.php_ wherever you want it to appear:

```
@include('backend.example.includes.sidebar-examples')
```

## Events and Listeners

The package generates three events and listeners for creating, updating and deleting items methods. In order to get these to work you must resgister them with the event dispatcher, adding this line to your _Providers/EventServiceProvider.php_ file (under _Backend Subscribers_):

```
\App\Listeners\Backend\Example\ExampleEventListener::class
```

## Language lines

Following are the _labels.php_, _menus.php_ and _validation.php_ English language lines needed, copy them into the files in _/resources/lang/en_ or whatever other language folder you may need. Replace _Example_ for the name of your Model.

TODO: generate a file with all the customized language lines ready to copy&paste.

**labels.php** under _'backend'_:

```
'examples' => [
    'management'    => 'Example Management',
